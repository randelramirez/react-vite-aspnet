## Different ways to use React(Vite) SPA with ASP.NET


## ðŸ“‹ To do: <br>

1.) React(vite) SPA hosted on Razor Page <br>
2.) Code clean up <br> 
3.) Check deployment for issues <br>

This approach meant that the launch code needed to be specific for each front-end framework, resulting in hard-to-maintain code for each front-end framework that the Microsoft team wanted to support. <br>

From .NET 6, the new templates for Angular and React switch how the front end and back end communicate. They use the front endâ€™s proxy solutions to send the request to the back end. The popular front-end frameworks already have built-in support for development server proxying, but they must also be configured each specific to the used framework. The ASP.NET app still launches the front-end development server, but the request comes from that server.

Advantages of this new approach include:

    Simpler configuration in the back-end files
    The back end is more independent from the front-end framework but not completely separate as the launch command and URL are still specific
    No more framework-specific code in the back endâ€™s Startup.cs or Program.cs files
    Extensible to other front-end frameworks not included in the templates


ViteProxy = uses front end proxy <br>
UseProxyToSpaDevelopment = front end is serve in the same port as ASP.NET Core <br>
